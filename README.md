# AI-Powered Quiz Generation System

This project features an **AI-powered quiz generation system** that creates customized practice questions based on user input. Designed to assist learners and educators, the system leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to dynamically generate quizzes tailored to specific topics, difficulty levels, and formats.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Quizzes**: Generate quizzes based on topics, difficulty levels, and question types (MCQs, True/False, Short Answer, etc.).
- **Adaptive Learning**: Tailors questions to user proficiency levels for an optimal learning experience.
- **Rich Question Formats**: Supports text-based, image-based, and code-based question generation.
- **Intuitive UI**: Easy-to-use interface for specifying quiz preferences and viewing results.
- **Export Options**: Download quizzes as PDFs or in JSON format for integration with other systems.
